<h3>Introducing Abstract Argumentation with Many Lives</h3>
<img src="images/katsav.jpg" title="Guilty: Moshe Katsav" alt="Guilty: Moshe Katsav">
<ul>
<li>2 cases of rape and indecent assault of A. from the Ministry of Tourism</li>
<li>An indecent act and sexual harassment of L. from the President's Residence</li>
<li>Sexual harassment of H. from the President's Residence</li>

<h2>A. from the Ministry of Tourism</h2>
<div class="opening">
<ul>
<li>The first charge relates to the work period of Katsav as Minister of Tourism and to Complainant A., who served in a senior position in his office during the relevant period.</li>
<li>In this charge, A. accuses Katsav of committing a rape offense on two occasions: one in Katsav's office in Tel Aviv in April 1998, and the second at the Plaza Hotel in Jerusalem on June 17, 1998.</li>
<li>In addition, Katsav is charged with an offense of indecent assault which was committed in the apartment of A.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="closing">
<h4>Supporting evidence</h4>
<p>
At first, Katsav complained of an attempt to blackmail him by A., due to her threats of filing a sexual harassment complaint, however, the testimonies of A.'s statements regarding the violation of her by Katsav in real time, deny the claims raised by Katsav.<br>
In this context we note the testimony of Shaul Halali, who spoke with Katsav, at the request of A., before her dismissal, in order to try to improve the atmosphere that prevailed in the office.<br>
A. told Halali that she was "very upset" because Katsav "sends long hands".<br>
Not only did he meet Katsav in his office, but Katsav even phoned him the day after the meeting in order to ascertain his impression.<br>
When Katsav's response to his testimony was requested, he denied, with ostentatious contempt, his meeting with Halali, as well as his conversation with him, even though his defense counsel had to admit afterwards that the meeting was held, since it was mentioned in the letter of dismissal, Written by Katsav himself.<br>
We shall also mention the testimony of Shmuel Tzurel, who served at the relevant times in a senior position in the Ministry of Tourism, who told the court that A. told him that Katsav was sexually harassing her: "I will say that he sexually harassed me".<br>
When Tzurel appealed to the director-general of the ministry, even without mentioning the content of A.'s complaint regarding the sexual harassment of Katsav, so that the latter would talk to A., he was reprimanded by Katsav who saw his interference with great severity.<br>
A special importance was attributed to the testimony of Attorney Ben-Tovim, to whom A. applied the day after her dismissal by Katsav, who told the court that A. told him: "The Minister harassed her sexually and that she felt that her work came to an end because she did not agree with him".<br>
Attorney Ben-Tovim confirmed that he had "blocked his ears" from hearing about the sexual issue, even though he understood that it was more than sexual harassment, but he wrote a copy of A.'s statement, which he kept in a safe and presented to the court at the testimony.<br>
Other statements by A. regarding her sexual harassment by Katsav long before the affair broke out were heard by Dror Nissan, Yaron Armoza, Dr. Michal Sela, Ilana Dayan and others.<br>
All of the above statements, which came from A.'s mouth at the time of the events, contradict Katsav's contention that this is a later invention in order to get revenge.

<h2>H. from the President's Residence</h2>
<div class="opening">
<ul>
<li>H. accuses Katsav about three frontal hugs in 2003, when he served as president.</li>
<li>H. attributes the offense of sexual harassment to Katsav, while exploiting authority.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>H. claimed all along, both in her statements to the police about the hugs. In her version, these are hugs of an intimate nature, in which Katsav pressed her against his chest, as she is frozen with her hands beside her. H. insisted that she told Katsav after the first hug and during the second hugs that they were not in her favor and asked him to stop it, but Katsav continued and hugged her again for the third time. Additionally, her testimony was consistent with her statements to the police and the State Attorney's Office, and was noted for her minority, caution and precision, as well as the fact that she did not want to complain against Katsav, and was dragged into this case, that she did not wish for.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="closing">
<h4>Supporting evidence</h4>
<ul>
<li>Further reinforcement of the existence of sexual significanced hugs were found, in testimonies of "similar acts" which came from the words of L., N.A. and N.R. who also had a similar experience of hug, while they worked for Katsav. These testimonies serve to reinforce Katsav's intentions and reject the following argument from his mouth about a random and innocent hug.</li>
<li>Various victims described a man who was close to Katsav, helping him to terrorize the victims and lead them into his arms.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</article>
<article>
<h2>L. from the President's Residence</h2>
<div class="opening">
<ul>
<li>In the third charge we are dealing with the embraces that the defendant embraced L., who was 25 when she worked in the President's Residence and was subordinate to his authority, as well as statements of sexual content he had told her. In respect of these, the defendant is charged with offenses of indecent assault, as well as sexual harassment offenses while exploiting authority and labor relations.</li>
<li>The indictment alleges that during the working meetings held by the Defendant with L., while the two were in solitary confinement, the Defendant used to make personal remarks to her. So he told her that she is "cute" because she has "beautiful eyes" that she "looks beautiful today" because she is "dressed beautifully today" and so on.</li>
<li>The main point of the indictment relates to December 25, 2005, the date on which the defendant's 60th birthday party was held. L., who assisted in its organization, entered the defendant's office for the purpose of coordinating the final details. At the end of the meeting, she wished him a happy birthday. The defendant got up, told her that she deserved a hug, approached her and held her for a long time, pressing her body against his body, even tilting his face to her neck, to smell her, for sexual arousal. L., who was surprised by the defendant's act, left the office when she was upset and crying (this hug was called by us "birthday hug").</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="closing">
<h4>Supporting evidence</h4>
<ul>
<li>We can learn from N.R.'s, N.A.'s and H. testimonies of the defendant's practice of embracing the young women who are subject to him in unusual embraces. From N.A. We heard that he had hugged her on his birthday. After refusing to give him a kiss, he even asked her what she would do if he reached her room in the hotel, because of the question she canceled her participation in the conference she was about to take part in. The witness N.R. was also under the authority of the defendant, and told the court about two hugs that the defendant had embraced her. One hug by side, by the window and another, this time in front of her, when he returned from abroad. The defendant even called her in the evening and introduced himself as "Moshe" and offered to come visit her.</li>
<li>Various victims who did not know about each other described a pattern of repetitive harassment, whereby the initiation of "courtship" and an attempt to get close to the victims would begin in the offender's library and then continue in other places.</li>

<h2>Modeling the argument</h2>
<div class="opening">
<ul>
<li><u>Who VS who</u> - The three complainants (A., H. and L.) against Moshe Katsav.</li>
<li><u>Goal</u> - To convict Katsav of significant offenses with actual imprisonment.</li>
<li>Thanks to our article, we can now present the argument using a network of signs.</li>
<li>S - The participants in the case.</li>
<li>R - Who VS who, that is, the accusers against the accused.</li>
<li>M - Life, the more life a participant has, the harder it is to "kill" him.</li>
<li>K - The power of the attack.</li>
<li>Î²<sub>m</sub> - A bonus of 1 attack power, when there are more than m accusers, we assign m=1 (we will get to it later on).</li>

<h2>The plea bargain: June 28, 2007</h2>
<img src="images/demo1.png" title="Demonstration 1" alt="Demonstration 1">
<h4>We ask the question, why 10 - 5 - 3 = 1?</h4>
<h2>Explanation:</h2>
<div class="opening">
<ul>
<li>Katsav, who was working as the president at that time was a very powerful person, so we shall give him a high amount of life: 10.</li>
<li>Back in 2007 due to problems in the schedule of A.'s testimony and expectations of difficulties in finding a proof required for proving rape, the prosecution decided it would be better to go for a plea bargain.</li>
<li>The plea bargain was very lenient for Katsav, in which he was not received a prison sentence but only two years' probation. Katsav was charged by A. only for indecent assault (see above) and by L. for sexual harassment.</li>
<li>It is seen from the deal that Katsav was not far from getting an active prison sentence, and that if Katsav had not been the president of the state, he would have actually been arrested.</li>
<li>If we wanted to define our purpose in another way, for example only to convict him, we would place a lower value on the life of Katsav.</li>
<li>Due to the severity of A.'s accusation against Katsav and the allegations of two rapes that were not part of the plea bargain, we defined the power of A.'s attack against Katsav as 5.</li>
<li>In the plea bargain L. accused Katsav of sexual harassment, that was considered lesser offenses than indecent assaults and rape suspicions, so we defined the power of L.'s attack on Katsav about one-third of Katsav's life.</li>
<li>Since there are similar charges from 2 complainants we assume that the total attack strength will be slightly greater so we add 1 more to the overall attack strength: 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculation of life after attack</h2>
<div class="opening">
<img src="images/calc.png" title="Calculation of Life" alt="Calculation of Life">
</div>
</article>
<article>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class="opening">
<ul>
<li>Katsav's Life: Starting life (10) minus* [Addition of Î² (1) if there's more than 1 accuser (m=1) + delta of kroncker (1) multiplied by the attack power of L. on Katsav (3) + delta of kroncker (1) multiplied by the attack power of A. on Katsav (5)] = 1. *What's inside the brackets must be less than or equal to the starting life of the accused.</li>
<li>No one attacks the complainants, the complainants have already given their testimonies, so the delta of each one is 1.</li>
<li>From here we showed that Katsav is still "alive", meaning that the charges were not strong enough to put him in jail.</li>
<li>At the opening of his trial on April 8, 2008, in which Katsav had to admit the suspicions attributed to him, his lawyers announced that Katsav had retracted the plea bargain.</li>
<li>Katsav made a very easy plea bargain, but one of the victims announced that she intended to speak out in front of the court and asked to describe her horrors (it was not an interrogation, but she wanted to take advantage of her right to speak). Apparently, Katsav was very concerned about this, and especially that standing before judges and a full description of his crimes, which would apparently have reached the media, would have further stigmatized his name, and perhaps even his supporters would have avoided him. Therefore, it is believed that this was one of the reasons for Katsav's decision to reject the plea bargain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sentence: On 30 December 2010</h2>
<img src="images/demo2.png" title="Demonstration 2" alt="Demonstration 2">
<h4>We ask the question, why Katsav has 10 life if before he had 1?</h4>
<h2>Explanation:</h2>
<div class="opening">
<ul>
<li>Each sentence or plea bargain is essentially a rearrangement of all the factors. Therefore, we will use a new network in which Katsav's life remains 10. Moreover, more and more new supporting evidence has been added as well as the accuser H.</li>
<li>In 2010, Katsav was convicted by the Tel Aviv court of two rape offenses and an indecent assault of A. from the Tourism Ministry, A sexual harassment of A. from the President's Residence, For offenses of indecent assault and sexual harassment of L. from the President's Residence and for the offense of obstructing court proceedings when he tried to coordinate versions with L. from the President's Residence.</li>
<li>Would Katsav be in prison only from A.'s indictment? The indictment of two cases of rape and the commission of an indecent act is a very serious charge, but we speak of former President Moshe Katsav and there was no such precedent before in the State of Israel. It is doubtful that only A's attack on Katsav would be enough. For example, people would ask themselves - why would the former head of the council, a minister in the Israeli government and president of the state innocent so far, decide to rape Mrs. A.? From here we define A's attack on Katsav as 9, a tiny amount less of Katsav's life.</li>
<li>H. accused Katsav of sexual harassment. A slight offense relative to the rest. Let's define the power of the attack at 3.</li>
<li>L. accuses Katsav of committing an indecent act, sexual harassment and obstruction of justice. Although the offenses are difficult but relative to the indictment of A. These are lighter offenses but their power(H --> Katsav) is greater than the charge of H., Therefore: We define the attack power of L. as 5, between the strength of A. and H' attack.</li>
<li>Since there are similar charges from 3 complainants, we assume that the total attack strength will be slightly greater so we add another 1 to the total attack strength:  9 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 17 > the life of Katsav. Therefore, the intensity of the attack = 10.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</article>
<article>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<div class="opening">
<ul>
<li>The life of Katsav after the attack: Starting life (10) minus* [Addition of Î² (1) if there is more than one accuser (m = 1) + Kroncker Delta (1) multiplied by the attack power of L. on Katsav (5) + Kroncker Delta (1) multiplied by the attack power of H. on Katsav (3) + Kroncker Delta (1) multiplied by the attack power of A. on Katsav (9)] = 0. *What's inside the brackets must be less than or equal to the life of the attacked.</li>
<li>No one attacks the complainants, the complainants have already given their testimonies, so the delta of each one is 1.</li>
<li>From here we saw that Katsav was "dead", meaning that the charges were strong enough to put him in jail and indeed he received seven years in prison.</li>
<li>Epilogue: The judges noted that Katsav's alibi was refuted and his testimony was "laced with lies". As a result, he was the only president of the State of Israel convicted in the trial. On March 22, 2011, the District Court sentenced Katsav to seven years in prison, two years probation and 125,000 NIS refund for the complainants.</li>
<li>Katsav appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, but his appeal was rejected. On December 7, 2011, Katsav began to serve his sentence in the religious wing of Maasiyahu Prison. His request for an additional hearing was rejected. In October 2013, Katsav submitted a request for a retrial to Supreme Court President Asher Grunis, saying that there was a miscarriage of justice in his conviction. His application was rejected in May 2014 stating that he had not been deformed.</li>
<li>On December 18, 2016, the release committee decided to release him early, but at the request of the State Attorney's Office, his release was delayed, in order to be able to appeal that decision. In the end, Katsav was released from prison on December 21, 2016, with various restrictions imposed on him.</li>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<div>
<h4>The incident in the apartment of A.</h4>
<p>
After Katsav learned that she was living alone - he invited himself to her.<br>
She evaded with various excuses, but in the end the visit was carried out.<br>
When he arrived at the apartment, he committed an indecent act when he reached for her chest.<br>
"He started to approach me and try to put his hand on my chest, in short... I'm going back... until I got stuck in the closet... I had nowhere to run. Evantually he put his hand on my chest and then I pushed him away... I pushed him... no excess power, no kick, no kick... I just pushed... I pushed him with my hands."
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>The event at Tel Aviv bureau of A.</h4>
<p>
This event took place about three or four months after she started to work, after the end of a mass event held at some park in Tel Aviv, Katsav told her that he "forgot something" in his office and asked her to accompany him.<br>
When they entered the office, A. sat on one of the chairs, Katsav sat next to her and began touching her.<br>
<span>
A struggle develops between the two as Katsav pulls down her pants and she pulls them up again.<br>
At one point, A. found herself sitting on the floor of the office, and immediately afterwards she reached a lying down state: "I kept fighting and saying that I did not want to, silently without shouting. Stop, I'm not interested. I do not want to. I tried to resist with my body and then he, I do not remember exactly at what stage... penetrated his penis into me."<br>
</span>
A. testified that the incident in the office occurred no more than 10-15 minutes, and that the rape was cut off.<br>
"Either I pushed it out or I turned around, I do not remember exactly how it ended."
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>The event at the hotel of A.</h4>
<p>
A. said that this incident occurred about two months after the rape in the office.<br>
It was one afternoon when Katsav worked at the Jerusalem bureau when he told her he wanted to rest in a hotel.<br>
A. ordered a room for him in the Plaza Hotel in Jerusalem, and as planned, joined him after a while, in order to go over various documents and complete the work for that day.<br>
A. said that when she arrived at the hotel, Katsav phoned her and told her that he had not yet finished organizing and that he wanted her to go upstairs.<br>
When she thought it was just for a few minutes, she did. A. went up to the right floor, knocked on the door, opened it, and entered the room and noticed that Katsav was wearing a long shirt, but without his pants.<br>
<span>
A., embarrassed by the situation, sat down on the edge of the bed in the room and looked away from Katsav, thinking that he would immediately put on his pants and they would go out to the lobby.<br>
Instead, Katsav approaches her and clings her from the front, she tries to get away, but he continues to approach.<br>
A. fell on the bed, Katsav leaned over her and pulled off her pants and managed to remove them, spread her legs and penetrated her.<br>
Here, too, Katsav did not arrive at a sexual release, since A. succeeded in pushing him away.
</span>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Extension to L.</h4>
<ul>
<li>In her testimony to the court, she also recounted another statement by the defendant who told her that she had "sensual lips."</li>
<li>In court L. told that on the afternoon of the day the defendant was attending his birthday party, she entered his office to give him a final update, when the defendant asked her if he did not deserve a hug for his birthday. He went to her and hugged her. L. demonstrated the manner of the hug, showing that the defendant had embraced her face to face with his hands behind her back and he was holding her close to him. She also testified that she felt the defendant sniff her neck as she, on her part, froze in her place with her hands to the sides. L. left the office upset and burst into tears.</li>
<li>It was further claimed that on another occasion, whose timing is not known precisely, a similar incident took place in which the defendant hugged L. in the front. In her testimony, L. got over her reluctance to tell about the extra hug, and said: "I remember that there was one more hug for sure".</li>
